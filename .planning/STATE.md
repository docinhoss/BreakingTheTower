### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- Phase 3 (Movement Extraction) flagged as highest risk - tightly coupled Peon.tick() lines 109-156
- Golden master testing MUST exist before any structural refactoring (critical safety net)
- Avoid full rewrite temptation - use 50-line extraction rule
